<!-- <favourite [isFavourite]="post.isFavourite"></favourite> -->

<!-- This property binding doesn’t work because in Angular in order for you to use property binding you need to define the property for that field as an input property.

 In order to make a component more reusable you want to add a bunch of input and output properties. we use input properties to pass a state/input and we use output properties to raise events from his custom components.

 The  combination of input and output properties for a component, make up what we call public API which stands for application programming interface.

now our favourite component doesn’t currently have a public API because it doesn’t have any input or output properties.

let's go to favourite.component.ts -->



<!-- aliasing -->
<!-- <favourite [is-favourite]="post.isFavourite"></favourite> -->

<!-- output/event -->
<favourite [is-favourite]="post.isFavourite" (change)="onFavouriteChanged($event)"></favourite>
